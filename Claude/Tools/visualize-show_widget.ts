/**
 * Tool: visualize:show_widget
 * 
 * Description: Show visual content — SVG graphics, diagrams, charts, or interactive HTML widgets — that renders inline alongside your text response. Use for flowcharts, architecture diagrams, dashboards, forms, calculators, data tables, games, illustrations, or any visual content. The code is auto-detected: starts with <svg = SVG mode, otherwise HTML mode. A global sendPrompt(text) function is available — it sends a message to chat as if the user typed it. IMPORTANT: Call read_me before your first show_widget call. Do NOT narrate or mention the read_me call to the user — call it silently, then respond as if you went straight to building the visualization.

interface VisualizeShowWidgetInput {
  title: string; // Short snake_case identifier for this visual. Must be specific and disambiguating — if the conversation has multiple visuals, this title alone should tell you which one is being referenced (e.g. 'q4_revenue_by_product_line' not 'chart', 'oauth_login_flow' not 'diagram'). Also used as the download filename, so no spaces or special characters.
  widget_code: string; // SVG or HTML code to render. For SVG: raw SVG code starting with <svg> tag, must use CSS variables for colors. Example: <svg viewBox="0 0 700 400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">...</svg>. For HTML: raw HTML content to render, do NOT include DOCTYPE, <html>, <head>, or <body> tags. Use CSS variables for theming. Keep background transparent and avoid top-level padding. Scripts are supported but execute after streaming completes.
  loading_messages: string[]; // 1–4 loading messages shown to the user while the visual renders, each roughly 5 words long. Write them in the same language the user is using. Use 1 for simple visuals, more for complex ones. If the topic is serious — illness, disease, pandemics, death, grief, war, conflict, poverty, disaster, trauma, abuse, addiction, medical decisions, politically charged subjects, or anything where the reader might be personally affected — keep these BORING: describe what the code is doing in the dullest generic way, no jargon-as-drama, no evocative terms. Minimum 1 item, maximum 4 items.
